Thought Process:
Originally, I wanted a conversation chatbot which would generate a response based on the user's input. I had little to no knowledge of self learning and how to implement it into my code. So I created a rule based bot which would ask the user questions and thus based on their answer, the bot will pick a response. It also has a weather api administerd into the bot. The code for the rule based bot can be found in the file Rules1.py.

However, implmenting my rule based bot into the interface proved extremely difficult. Hence I went back to brainstorming and came up with another idea. I wanted a chatbot which would allow me to write down my ideas or any funny quotes which would arise in my day to day life. Hence I researched databases/files and came up with the idea of a notepad bot. A notepad seemed simple, yet effective in what I wanted to accomplish. 

Interface:
I used Discord as the interface for my chatbot. It has an innovative design and had an extensive documentation for intergrating python. Link to the documentation: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ . Discord is also what my group used for communication with each other as meeting up was not always an option.  

Code:
The code for the notebook bot can be found in the the file Notepad.py.

Commands:
!addquote ("Whatever you want the bot to remember") - Adds the quote/paragraph to the file
!quote - Calls the quote from the file and displays it 

Issues:
The Notepad bot can only currerntly store one quote at a time. When you call a quote it only remembers the most current instance and I am currently tinkering looking for a fix. 

Groupwork:
We could not all agree on a singular project to work on. So we decided it would be best to split off an do our own indviusal projects. However we would still discuss with each oter via Discord and ask for advice and for any critiiscm. We would use planning poker in order to estimate the time needed for work, in order to meet the weekly deadlines for the Active Led Learning module.. 

After the Project:
The project gave me invaluble experience implementing python into different interfaces and also applying scrum techniques in order ot be more effective and effecient during my work.
